## What Iâ€™m Working On  
Iâ€™m always eager to stay ahead of the curve by exploring the latest frontend technologies and refining my craft. Currently, Iâ€™m diving deeper into:  
- âš¡ Advanced React and Next.js patterns, performance optimization, and scalable architecture.  
- GraphQL and headless APIs as efficient, modern alternatives to traditional REST workflows.  
- Modern build tools like Vite & Bun and focusing on full-stack or edge-capable architectures.
